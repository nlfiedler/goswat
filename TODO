GoSwat Checklist (-*- text -*-)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- evaluate the exp/ogle package
  - how far along is it?
  - how much can be reused?
  - see how it uses debug/elf and debug/drawf
- evaluate the debug packages (drawf, elf, etc) for re-use
- what support for ELF is available in Go?
  - see src/pkg/debug/elf
- learn about DWARF (http://www.dwarfstd.org/)
  - is there any Go package for reading DWARF?
    - see src/pkg/debug/drawf
  - if not, check out libdwarf (http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/elftoolchain/wiki/libdwarf)
- evaluate Picol as an alternative to gotcl (http://antirez.com/page/picol.html)
  - looks good; easy to understand; clean C code
  - needs to be translated to idiomatic Go code
  - less code to start with, so more work/fun to develop
- evaluate gotcl (http://code.google.com/p/gotcl/)
  - so called "tcl-like" language, probably not a good base for starting
  - not a full fledged Tcl interpreter
  - has most of the basics
